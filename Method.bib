  abstract = {A general coefficient measuring the similarity between two sampling units is defined. The matrix of similarities between all pairs of sample units is shown to be positive semidefinite (except possibly when there are missing values). This is important for the multidimensional Euclidean representation of the sample and also establishes some inequalities amongst the similarities relating three individuals. The definition is extended to cope with a hierarchy of characters.},

This silhouette shows which objects he well within their cluster, and which ones are merely somewhere in between clusters. The entire clustering is displayed by combining the silhouettes into a single plot, allowing an appreciation of the relative quality of the clusters and an overview of the data configuration. The average silhouette width provides an evaluation of clustering validity, and might be used to select an ‘appropriate’ number of clusters.},

Under the stated hypothesis, H is distributed approximately as χ2(C – 1), unless the samples are too small, in which case special approximations or exact tables are provided. One of the most important applications of the test is in detecting differences among the population means.* * Based in part on research supported by the Office of Naval Research at the Statistical Research Center, University of Chicago.},

A planned comparison procedure that simplifies the tedious process of partitioning a contingency table by creating single-degree-of-freedom con trasts through a regression-based approach is proposed. Importantly, these post hoc methods supplement the analysis of standardized residuals by reporting the per centage contribution for each cell to the overall chi-square statistic (relative contri bution) and to the percentage of variance shared by the two factors (absolute contri bution). Both methods can be readily incorporated into existing statistical packages such as SAS or SPSS. The equivalence of the percentage contribution method to the more common standardized residual method is also presented along with an exam ple of a typical application.},

  abstract = {Methods for constructing simultaneous confidence intervals for all possible linear contrasts among several means of normally distributed variables have been given by Scheffé and Tukey. In this paper the possibility is considered of picking in advance a number (say m) of linear contrasts among k means, and then estimating these m linear contrasts by confidence intervals based on a Student t statistic, in such a way that the overall confidence level for the m intervals is greater than or equal to a preassigned value. It is found that for some values of k, and for m not too large, intervals obtained in this way are shorter than those using the F distribution or the Studentized range. When this is so, the experimenter may be willing to select the linear combinations in advance which he wishes to estimate in order to have m shorter intervals instead of an infinite number of longer intervals.},
